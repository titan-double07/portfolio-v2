      `At times, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge I needed to acquire ü§Ø, but I refused to give up. I persisted and continued to push forward, one step at a time üí™, until I realized how much I had grown. Looking back, I'm proud of the progress I have made and how far I have come üòå.,`,

Although I've had to reduce the amount of time I spend on these activities, I accept it as a small sacrifice to achieve my goal of becoming a developer.`,
